# RetroJoy — Static Site (MVP)

This is a small static HTML/CSS/JS site for the **RetroJoy** World Cup 2026 prediction game MVP.
Drop these files into a GitHub repository (public or private) and serve via GitHub Pages or any static host.

## What’s included
- `index.html` — single-page app with 4 views: Landing, Predict, Leaderboard, Shop
- `styles.css` — lightweight styles (white primary, blue & red trim)
- `script.js` — client-side logic using `localStorage` (no backend)
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use
1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload the files from this ZIP to the repository root.
3. (Optional) Enable GitHub Pages from the repository `Settings → Pages` to serve the site.
4. Open `index.html` in a browser or view the GitHub Pages URL.

Notes: This is an MVP intended to run client-side. For production you'll want a backend (Supabase/Airtable) to store picks and compute a central leaderboard.

Enjoy! — I can follow up by turning this into a Vite/React project or wiring a Supabase backend if you want.
